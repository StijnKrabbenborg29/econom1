Make a scatter with regular return (dependent variable) and indepdent variables. (You will see a non-linear trend)
proof why we use log return instead of regular return.

 0- Get the log return of prices 
 1- Merge the csv-s into a dataframe using time as id  
 2- Expand dataframe to get dummies for categorical variables  

Some theory dummy variables, and dummy variable trap
 3- Remove one dummy per category 
 4- remove first company from each sector    
 5- merge dummy for sector & industry, if the number of companies < number of industries for that sector ?? (not required)

 6- run pooled regression calculate R2 adjusted 
 7- run  implement with entity   fixed effects and time fixed effects compare R2 adjusted to pooled regression. Infer that both are better ? 

Models: 
1. Model with only Beta (restricted model 1)
2. Model with Beta + time effect (restricted model 2)
3. Model with Beta + sector effect (restricted model 3)
4. Model with Beta + time effect + sector effect (unrestricted model)

 8. Compare entity effects to time fixed effects using F statistic  Chose one with the highest. Compare each one to unrestricted  model ? 
 9 . Interpret summary results for best model 

Specific dummy variable per group in assignment:
Your choice is not free: If you are in group "A1 n", (where n is the number of *your* group), calculate d= n mod 3 + 1 and take dummy set d from the list above. Example: Group "A1 10" has n= 10, so d= n mod 3 + 1= 10 mod 3 + 1= 1 + 1= 2, hence group A1 10 will study the sector dummies as this is the second entry in the list above.

1. industry dummies (not included)
2. sector dummies
3. employee size dummies (not included)
